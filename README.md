# OnTracck

Welcome to OnTrack, a progressive web application aimed at helping you reach your health and fitness goals. This application is built with Deno, Deno Fresh, TypeScript, and Preact.

OnTrack's vision is to provide an intuitive platform that helps users make lifestyle changes that promote overall wellness and fitness. The tool offers health insights and fitness tracking mechanisms that keep you <strong>on track</strong> with your wellness journey.

## Getting Started

Before you dive in, make sure you have Deno installed on your machine. If you haven't, follow this [installation guide](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) to set it up.

The project uses Deno for its runtime environment, Deno Fresh as the framework, TypeScript for static typing, and Preact for efficient and flexible UI components.

### Usage

To start the development server and begin working with the project, use:<br/> 
```deno start task```
<br/>Upon executing the command, Deno will watch the project directory and restart as necessary, keeping your development process streamlined.

For more details on how to get started with Fresh in Deno, you can visit the Fresh "Getting Started" guide [here](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started).

Happy coding!
